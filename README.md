# SDG Goal Targeted: SDG-4 Quality Education



# Objective: 
Our goal with this comparative analysis is to provide meaningful insights into Eastern and Western Africa's unique educational challenges. By understanding the relative factors that contribute to out-of-school rates, we aim to mitigate them through our analysis to promote inclusive and accessible lower secondary education in these regions.
